# Next.js 13 app directory, unexpected token error when importing a module

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 13's App Directory where an unexpected token error occurs when importing a module.  The error is unexpected because the import statement appears syntactically correct.

## Bug Description

When importing a module into a page component within the app directory, a syntax error might unexpectedly occur, even if the import statement looks valid. This frequently happens when the imported module is structured in a way not fully compatible with Next.js 13's app directory routing and module resolution mechanisms. The error message points to an unexpected token, making debugging challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the module being imported and ensuring it's compatible with Next.js 13's app directory structure and conventions.  Common solutions are:
* **Correcting module export:** Ensure the module being imported has a valid and compatible export statement.
* **Checking file paths:** Verify the import path is accurate and correctly reflects the module's location relative to the importing file.
* **Using dynamic imports:** Consider using dynamic imports (`import()`).
* **Ensuring valid JavaScript:** A simple syntax error in the module can sometimes manifest as an unexpected token error in the importing file.
